## Quick Installation Guide

### Step 1: Create Icon Files
Before installing, you need to create the icon files:

1. Create three PNG files with these exact names:
   - `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
   - `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels) 
   - `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

2. You can:
   - Use any image editor (Paint, Photoshop, GIMP, etc.)
   - Download free icons from sites like icons8.com or flaticon.com
   - Create simple colored squares as placeholders

### Step 2: Install the Extension

1. Open Google Chrome
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top right)
4. Click "Load unpacked"
5. Select the `cinspam-automator` folder
6. The extension will appear in your extensions list

### Step 3: Use the Extension

1. Open Instagram.com in a Chrome tab
2. Click the extension icon in your toolbar
3. Enter usernames separated by commas (max 100)
4. Enter your message
5. Set delays (3-8 seconds recommended)
6. Click "Start Automation"

### Troubleshooting

**Icons not showing?**
- Make sure you created the PNG files with exact names
- Icons should be in the same folder as manifest.json

**Extension not loading?**
- Check that all files are in the same folder
- Make sure manifest.json is valid
- Try refreshing the extensions page

**Not working on Instagram?**
- Make sure you're logged into Instagram
- Refresh the Instagram page
- Check that the extension has permissions

### Safety Tips

- Start with 2-3 usernames to test
- Use realistic delays (3-8 seconds)
- Don't send the same message to too many people
- Follow Instagram's community guidelines
